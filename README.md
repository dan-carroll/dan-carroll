### Rather Be Coding! ✍

That is my tagline. It's what I would put on a 👕 t-shirt or 🧢 cap, and wear it. It is what I really prefer to be doing at almost any time.

I can not see a problem, or hear someone discussing a problem, without thinking about 🤔 how to solve the problem with code. Does that make me a little wierd.🤪 Maybe.

I have discovered that I am a problem solver. 🧩 Puzzles of any kind have gotten me going. As a kid, I always wanted to get the prize out of the Cracker Jack or cereal box, not because I wanted a new gadget or toy, but because I wanted to put whatever it was together. Then I would hand it off to a sibling to play with.

I started my career as an electronic 📻 tech where I learned computers 🖥 from the inside out. Then learned how much fun programming was. And even became the proprietor of my own computer store.

Github was a great idea. Thank you to all who have had a hand in it's creation and evolution. Now if I can only find some open source projects I can sink my teeth into. Coding or documenting.
