### Rather Be Coding!

That is my tagline. It's what I would put on a t-shirt or cap, and wear it. It is what I really prefer to be doing at almost any time.

I can not see a problem, or hear someone discussing a problem, without thinking about how to solve the problem with code. Does that make me a little wierd. Maybe.
